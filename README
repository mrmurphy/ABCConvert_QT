This tool requires Autodesk Maya 2012 to be installed and located in $PATH.
Also, the ABCImport and ABCExport plugins must be compiled and installed
into Maya.

This plugin can be found here:

This tool also requires Python 2.6


######### Some notes ###########
I used QT & Pyside for the interface, and in order to not block the UI while running 
the heavy conversion process, the controller spawns a process in a new thread.

The conversion process writes all of its information to a local Sqlite3 database, and
the UI checks that database regularly for updated information. When no scenes are being
converted, the UI stops checking the DB.

If the user deletes the DB file, a new DB file with all of the correct fields will be
set up automatically.


####### TODO ########

 -> Currently, the database is accessed in two ways, through QT's built-in methods, 
	and through the python Sqlite3 library. Unify this in the controller so that only
	one DB access method is used.
